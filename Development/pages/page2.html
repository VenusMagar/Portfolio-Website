								<p id="nav_types" class="textstyle2">We, humans, are integrating with technologies more and more every day. We can find technology everywhere; in education, business, industries, medicine, the military, and even in our daily lives and it's incredible. Most of us may think, the electrical gadgets or very complex things as technology. But, we are wrong because even a simple wheel is an early human technology. So, what exactly is technology? Technology is simply the system of problem-solving and practical ideas or knowledge to create tools and gadgets. And, the tools and gadgets created with the use of technology are known as applied technology. Technology is derived from two Greek words i.e., "techne" and "logos". Techne means the knowledge and skill to craft something and logos mean the study. We all are deeply connected with the technologies.</p>

								<!-- Creating a div for communication technology -->
								<div>
									<h2 class="textstyle3">1) Communication Technology:</h2>

									<!-- Creating a div for explanation of communication technology -->
									<div class="margin_types">
										<p class="textstyle2">Communication technology is one of the most essential types of technology at this time. No matter how far we are from each other, we can easily communicate with anyone. And, it has been made possible by communication technologies. Communication technology has been with us for a very long time ago. From the early forms of communication technologies like writing or drawing on walls of the cave, smoke signals, use of symbols to the modern forms of communication technologies like the internet, satellite communications, cellular networks, emails, etc. Communication technologies have a great role in worldwide interconnection and globalization.</p>
